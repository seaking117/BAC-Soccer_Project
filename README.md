This project was developed from Feb 2024 - May 2024. 
It contains code to investigate how soccer transfer fees are evaluated, and specifically, what key features of soccer players are used to investigate these things.
This code was paired with a slideshow, in which the insights from each of the plots produced in the code were explained.
